# ⚙️ Predictive Maintenance System (Machine Learning)

A web-based **Predictive Maintenance System** built using **Machine Learning** and **Streamlit** to monitor equipment health and predict potential faults based on sensor vibration data.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end ML pipeline including feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, model inference, and an interactive web interface.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Predictive maintenance aims to detect equipment failures **before they happen**, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.

This system:
- Accepts **sensor vibration readings**
- Extracts statistical features
- Applies **scaling + PCA**
- Predicts equipment condition (**Healthy / Faulty**)
- Displays confidence scores and maintenance recommendations
